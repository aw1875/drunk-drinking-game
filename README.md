# **üçª Drunk! The Crazy Drinking**

After seeing many people posting pictures of their drinking game boards on social media during the COVID19 pandemic, I decided to take one friends designs and convert it into a web based game that anyone can play. If you don't want to go through all the trouble of setting the project up yourself, you can find a live vesion [on my website](http://drunk.cashcollege.me)

## **Installation**
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is all that is required.

Start with running:
```sh
$ npm i
```
That should get all the node modules installed, this could take some time so go grab a drink or a snack. Once that finishes all you need to do is start the server. To do that, just run:
```sh
$ npm start
```

That's it, a localhost tab should open up on port 3000 and you're good to play! Grab your friends, hop in a call together, and enjoy!
