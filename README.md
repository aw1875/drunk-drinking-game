# **üçª Drunk! The Crazy Drinking**

After seeing many people posting pictures of their drinking game boards on social media during the COVID19 pandemic, I decided to take one friends designs and convert it into a web based game that anyone can play. If you don't want to go through all the trouble of setting the project up yourself, you can find a live vesion [on my website](http://drunk.cashcollege)

## **Installation**
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is required. That is all!

Start with running:
```sh
$ npm i
```
Let all the node modules intall, this could take some time so go grab a drink or a snack! Once that finishes all you need to do is start! To do that, just run:
```sh
$ npm start
```

That's it!. A localhost tab should open up on port 3000 and you're good to play! Grab you friends, hop in a call together, and enjoy!
